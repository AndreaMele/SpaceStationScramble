So what do we do now?

- someone does not know what to do
    -> ignorance
        -> not purely hand-eye skill

- the character is the hero of a game that has finished

- two player co-op where you can only see the other player's situation

- two player co-op where the solutions to one player's problems are visible on the other player's screen
